PubNub Chess Club
====================

This project is a fork of Julian Garnier's excellent 3D chess game that uses HTML/CSS/JS to do its 3D graphics.  I added a chat lobby with online users list to facilitate setting up chess matches that are playable over the Web. It uses the PubNub core messaging API and the Presence API, the latter of which makes managing online users groups easy. 

IMPORTANT: Works only in webkit.

NOTE: I took Julian's original files and pushed them into a Visual Studio 2013 solution.  However, it's really easy to take just the member files and use them in whatever programming IDE or text editor you like.
